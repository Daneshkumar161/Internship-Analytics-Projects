# Internship-Analytics-Projects

As part of my internship, I worked on a predictive modeling task using a dataset titled retail_store_inventory. The objective was to forecast product demand based on various inventory and store-related features by implementing a complete machine learning workflow. I began by importing and exploring the dataset to understand its structure. This was followed by thorough data cleaning, including handling missing values and ensuring proper data types. To understand patterns and relationships within the data, I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA). I then separated the target variable, “Demand Forecast,” and treated the remaining columns as feature variables. Using a linear regression model, I trained the model and generated predictions on unseen test data. The model’s performance was evaluated using standard regression metrics including Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R² score. Additionally, I visualized the results through an Actual vs. Predicted scatter plot and a residuals distribution to assess the prediction errors. This project helped me gain practical experience in end-to-end predictive modeling—from data preprocessing and model training to evaluation and visualization.
